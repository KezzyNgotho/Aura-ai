## Q&A Talking Points

**"How is this different from ChatGPT?"**
> ChatGPT is general. We're specialized. More importantly, we SHOW our work. And we reward users for using us through the token economy.

**"What's the business model?"**
> Three revenue streams: (1) Premium tokens users buy, (2) Enterprise API licensing, (3) Optional contextual ads. We're not forcing subscriptions - users only pay when they want premium features.

**"How do you ensure quality insights?"**
> Three layers: (1) Structured framework prevents generic advice, (2) Community voting surfaces quality, (3) Improvement suggestions encourage iterative refinement.

**"Can you scale this?"**
> Yes - we're built on Cloudflare Workers, which handles millions of requests globally. Database is infinitely scalable KV. No servers to manage. Just deploy and forget.

**"Why Model Context Protocol?"**
> It's the emerging standard for AI agent communication. By building on MCP, we become a plugin for every AI tool in the ecosystem, not just our own interface.

**"What's next?"**
> Post-hackathon: (1) LLM integration for dynamic generation, (2) Mobile apps, (3) WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord full integration, (4) Expert marketplace, (5) Enterprise licensing.
